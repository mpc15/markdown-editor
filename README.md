# Random Quote Generator
##### _A quote generator machine that randomly displays famous quotes when clicked by the user_
***

This is the repo for a random quote generator I built with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5. The goal was to have the machine randomize the quote selection whenever the user clicked the "Get Quote" button. These quotes can also be shared on Twitter when the user clicks the Tweet button.
